# ciciwiki

I have tried so many ways to organize my thoughts, learnings, references and links. This wiki is my latest attempt to handle that organization. I used many other sites for the inspiration of this wiki. The main one that I even used many links from is [https://wiki.nikiv.dev/](nikitavoloboev). I decided to use [https://gohugo.io/](Hugo) for this wiki as well as the [https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn/index.html](Relearn) theme.

## Run Locally
