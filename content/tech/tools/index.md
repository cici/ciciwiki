Tools I use & like are mentioned in [my workflow](../sharing/my-workflow.md). [Toolhunt](https://www.toolhunt.dev/) has a nice tools list. [Uses This](https://usesthis.com/) does nice interviews on tools people use.

One of my favorite things in life is building little tools for solving even the tiniest of frictions I experience in life.
