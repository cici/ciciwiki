      <description>2Do I love GTD methodology. This app is phenomenal with helping me organize my tasks.
It&amp;rsquo;s my preferred and main app for todos until I build my own app for this.
Here is how my sidebar looks:
It also has global quick add with a hotkey. Together with lists, priorities, powerful search and a lot more.
I use 2Do only for personal tasks. Team &amp;amp; project tasks are done on GitHub.</description>

      <description>Alfred Alfred is a powerful launcher that you can program to show anything you want. It saved me a lot of time as I use it to search through anything instantly.
It has a great community and amazing workflows that you can use.
I wrote an article on how anyone can start developing workflows of their own using Go language and AwGo library.
Raycast &amp;amp; Script Kit are nice alternatives.</description>

      <description>AwGo An awesome library to make Alfred Workflows made by Deanishe.
Notes Using macOS console app is a lot nicer than using Alfred debugger. You can access it by running workflow:log in a script filter. Where workflow: is a magic argument with a bunch of other dev related things you can run. You need to add unique UID to have Alfred learn from your usage. </description>

      <guid>http://example.org/tech/macos/apps/bettertouchtool/index.html</guid>
      <description>BetterTouchTool I use BTT to customize different trackpad gestures either globally or on per app basis. I also use BTT for all my window management needs (move window left/right or maximize).
You can download my BTT Profile and import it to your BetterTouchTool to get all gestures I setup for myself (or just look around and see what you like). Gestures that save me most time are moving between tabs with three finger gestures (+ closing/opening tabs with up &amp;amp; down gestures).</description>

      <guid>http://example.org/tech/macos/apps/contacts/index.html</guid>
      <description>Contacts I use Contacts app as a contact book of people I both know and people I am interested in.
I use this workflow to quickly search through all my contacts. I add tags (i.e. the name of event we met at or person&amp;rsquo;s skills/interests) to make both the searching and remembering who the person is or what he/she does easier.
I add [ to contacts that are of greater importance.</description>

      <guid>http://example.org/tech/macos/apps/fantastical/index.html</guid>
      <description>Fantastical I use the app to manage events in my life I sync with Google Calendar.
I always view my events from Week view &amp;amp; have 7 days in view with 18 hours shown in one view. This gives perspective over current and upcoming events/deadlines. All events created by default have 30 min duration.
I often switch between Week and Month views.
Cron &amp;amp; Amie are nice too.
Notes To mass delete events, make empty search query (single space) on events I want to remove and delete them.</description>

      <description>Hazel I once used Hazel to sort things in ~/Downloads folder.
You can sync Hazel rules with Dropbox.
Notes If you want to have your rules to be applied onto subfolders as well as the directory chosen, add this rule. If extensions are hidden, don&amp;rsquo;t add extensions in the rule editor too. Links Reference hazel file path Hazel Debug Mode Nice use cases of Hazel </description>

      <description>iTerm Moved to Warp terminal from iTerm.
Use Zsh as my shell together with Antibody plugin manager and Pure theme.
Assigned w + j with Karabiner to open the app from Keyboard Maestro in seconds.
I used Primer GitHub theme for iTerm. And share my iTerm preferences.
I have iTerm switch between Primer Light and Primer Dark themes as I change between macOS appearances.
Primer Light

My workflow I always have at least 3 tabs (sessions) always open in iTerm.</description>

      <guid>http://example.org/tech/macos/apps/karabiner/karabiner/index.html</guid>
      <description>Karabiner Karabiner is life changing tool that lets you remap keys at a low level on macOS.
I completely remapped my keyboard with it and every key on my keyboard is a custom modifier key that I can program to do what I want.
For example you can make caps lock into an escape key when pressed once but if you hold it, it becomes a hyper key. Hyper key means that a key now serves two purposes, once when pressed alone and once when held down.</description>

      <guid>http://example.org/tech/macos/apps/keyboard-maestro/keyboard-maestro/index.html</guid>
      <description>Keyboard Maestro Keyboard Maestro is essentially an IDE for automation. You create macros of actions that you can then easily call from Karabiner.
It has a wonderful community that is happy to help with whatever you are trying to achieve.
I share all the macros I use with the app.
Notes It is always better to run compiled AppleScripts. Assert action. &amp;ldquo;If not condition, then fail&amp;rdquo;. Useful for checking if you got right kind of data.</description>

      <description>Timing I once used Timing app to fully automate tracking time I spend on my computer.
I setup projects in Timing with rules assigned for each project. I then had Timing infer time I spent on these projects automatically based on the rules.
No longer use any tracking apps as part of my minimization of tools I use.

ShadowVim seems nice too.
Notes &amp;ldquo;Run without building&amp;rdquo; has saved me so much time, it&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous Use different colours for the console output to make the log output easier to reason about Xcode can show the view frames in a running app Wondering about an unfamiliar Xcode build setting? Try option+double clicking on it in the target editor for a descriptive tooltip. Don&amp;rsquo;t install Xcode from app store if you need it to work.</description>
