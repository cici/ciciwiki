It saved me a lot of time as I use it to search through anything instantly.\nIt has a great community and amazing workflows that you can use.\nI wrote an article on how anyone can start developing workflows of their own using Go language and AwGo library.\nRaycast \u0026 Script Kit are nice alternatives.\nWorkflows I use My most used workflows at current time are:\nSearchio GitHub Jump Web Searches Learn Anything Safari Assistant Ask, Create Share My Mind Maestro Fast Menu Bar Search Coupled with many small workflows I made. I hope to add more workflows of my own to the mix with time.\nAlfred theme I most often use Mono Dim theme when in macOS dark appearance.\nI use Mono Light theme with macOS light appearance (when light is hitting the screen).\nI also made Mono theme but stopped using it.\nThe themes work best with GitHub VSCode \u0026 iTerm dim themes.\nSnippets I use Alfred together with Keyboard Maestro to automate text expansions. Alfred for simple expansions, KM for complex or per app expansions.\nSymlink workflows It is a great idea to symlink workflows you are working on so you can work on them in the comfort of your file system and not inside Alfred UUID named directories.\nI use this script to achieve this. In example of this workflow you can use it as follows. Assuming the workflow directory contains Alfred workflow contents (info.plist file). You can run workflow-install.py -s workflow.\nI can also then use this script and build my workflow with workflow-build.py -v source.\nNotes Package workflows from CLI with version numbers Alfred can preserve a user’s Hotkey shortcuts, keywords and workflow variable values. Everything else in the workflow directory gets overwritten. I prefix my own workflows that I have not published out to the world with a. prefix. This way I know off hand that this workflow is either private or unreleased yet. Sometimes when passing things from one object into another, you want to clear your {query} being passed to get a clean prompt. To achieve this you can set argument utility and set it as empty like here: You can exclude certain folders or files from being searched. For example, if you have a file filter that searches through some folders and its contents but you don’t wish for it to search some big node_modules folder. You can simply add this folder to Spotlight preferences under privacy tab like here: Adding alfred:ignore tag to files/folders will have Alfred ignore the file/folder in its searches. If you copy the selected text, then open Alfred’s clipboard manager, you can use cmd+s on the selected clipboard entry, and this will open Alfred’s preferences and pre-fill a snippet for you to save. File note found? Go to Alfred’s preferences \u003e Help \u003e Troubleshooting and run the File Search Troubleshooting, dragging in some of the files you are expecting to see in your File Filter. Check the Content Type: field. It could be something like com.unknown.md instead of net.daringfireball.markdown you might expect. Code Strip title and subtext from input. Put inside JSON utility.

In future I want Contacts to be something that’s handled by LA as it can do an even better job and export details into Contacts.app too.\nNotes It’s a common mistake for founders to hire or give stock to someone for access to their Rolodex of powerful contacts. The value of such lists is always exaggerated. And if you build something great, the powerful will seek you out anyway; that’s how they got to be powerful. If you build something great, a network of contacts will naturally grow out of it. And if you don’t, no network can save you anyway. Links Monica - Personal CRM.

The list of topics will change over time.\nIf this is your first time visiting this wiki, take a look here as it describes this wiki, its structure and goals.\nBelow are my 1,000+ topics \u0026 their relations visualized.\n~/src/docs/knowledge ❯ loc -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Language Files Lines Blank Comment Code -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Markdown 1000 95000 5000 0 100000 Getting started This garden is quite literally my digital brain. It includes my thoughts, notes and links on topics I care about.\nSee here for all topics I have in this wiki.\nThe content being markdown files found here, which after every commit to the GitHub repo builds the website using Docusaurus and publishes it to wiki.nikiv.dev from which you are likely reading this page.\nLots of this content will one day live or co exist with Learn Anything project I work on.\nIf you use mac, Alfred My Mind plugin is incredible. I plan to make both the plugin and this setup with the wiki reusable by anyone.\nI also want to learn to write well written articles and make high quality YouTube videos.\nAnd of course I love writing code that solves various problems I have and I share it all on GitHub. I also love Reddit, HN \u0026 Lobsters as far as communities go.\nHere you can find all the things I made and shared thus far.\nThat was long. 😺\nI tried to write it as both a reference you can skim to get the best info on how to use this wiki or ideally inspire you to make a wiki of your own. There are many great wikis out there and the list grows with every day. All the tools are there.\nMust read pages There’s 1,000+ pages in here and lots of them I think are interesting. But these few can be nice starts for a read:\nSolving Problems describes my approach to find problems to solve and solving them effectively. Karabiner as it describes a genuinely life changing tool that makes updating this wiki and operating my mac at fast speeds possible VSCode \u0026 Sublime Text for similar reason as Karabiner, life changing tools. I use Sublime Text for editing this wiki and VSCode for writing code. Mostly TypeScript and Go now. Happiness includes my lessons I learned for how to live a happier life Focusing as it’s a very important page for me. It links to other important to me pages: Rules \u0026 Habits. These 2 pages are essentially a summary of my life as far as my value system / lessons learned / habits go. Relationships is another important to me area in life as I want to be someone friends think fondly of and it contains my thoughts on that My Workflow includes a summary of what I use in life. Looking Back as it’s my life diary. It includes a lot of how I felt, what I thought about and did at any point in time starting from 2017 when I first started writing a journal. There is a lot more out there but I think above is a good start. Hope you find some of it interesting. ♥️\nAs far as tech goes, my current obsessions, goals and ideas for how to live a better future are learning more of Solid and Go/Swift to build amazing experiences.\nContent Structure As mentioned, I like to keep a sort of structure for pages. It’s roughly:\nTitle with optional description to describe topic. My thoughts on the topic. Subtopics - Various subtopics related to the main topic. i.e. Alfred page has a few subtopics. Notes - Notes on the topic as well as things I found interesting on the internet regarding the topic. I often give a link of where I got things from. Code - Code snippets. Links - Links related to the topic. Grow your own digital garden 🌱 As I mentioned, these wikis are also called digital gardens. There is a DigitalGardens community on Reddit which discusses tools to maintain \u0026 create these wikis. As well as how to use them to develop new transformative tools for thought.\nI collected a list of wikis I liked the most for inspiration. For example, Devine’s Wiki is a great rabbit hole of fascinating info. Devine is one half of 100 Rabbits which is fascinating couple that lives on a boat and does art. I want to live a life like this one day but alas.\nI ♥️ meeting new people so feel free to reach out. I also hope you share what you know with the world as a form of a wiki like this too. It truly had a life changing effect on my life.\nContents 3d Printing Analytics Grafana Animals Birds Anki API tRPC Art Anime Architecture Clothes Comics Dancing Drawing Furniture Generative art

    "content": "Karabiner Karabiner is life changing tool that lets you remap keys at a low level on macOS.\nI completely remapped my keyboard with it and every key on my keyboard is a custom modifier key that I can program to do what I want.\nFor example you can make caps lock into an escape key when pressed once but if you hold it, it becomes a hyper key. Hyper key means that a key now serves two purposes, once when pressed alone and once when held down. So for example for remapping caps lock, we can remap it to act as escape when pressed alone once but if we hold down on it it becomes ⌘ + ⌃ modifier key. So caps lock + F becomes ⌘ + ⌃ + F. And so on.\nI take this idea further and define these kind of hyper keys but for every single key on my keyboard.\nMy personal Karabiner setup I generate my Karabiner config with Goku.\nWill make a web explorer for Karabiner/Goku bindings soon. But briefly, I group keys by theme. q = cmd+shift. w = open apps. e = cmd. r = open more apps. i = insert symbols like \u0026 or |. o = Alfred searches. a = control. s = arrow keys, selecting text \u0026 more text helpers. d = d+v will do left mouse click, use that a lot. f = various helpers. g = move windows left/right/maximize \u0026 more. hjkl are no hyper keys as I press on them often for scrolling in vim/browser and need instant response, hyper keys have a little delay after press. : = caps lock key, so :+w will insert W. z = open chat apps, like z+k opens telegram. x = spotify helpers, like current song, search songs \u0026 more. c = helpers, use c+s often to clone current open GitHub URL \u0026 open it in VSCode. v = change volume, next song \u0026 more. b = open ’news’ sites like Reddit/HN. n = Alfred searches, use n+s to trigger web searches often. m = search Dash docsets with Alfred. . = insert text fast like console.log() \u0026 more.\nInteresting configs Goku In The Wild George Nica Max Stoiber’s Karabiner config/generator Dmitry Zherebko Notes I can embed simultaneous key mappings inside sticky key definitions.
